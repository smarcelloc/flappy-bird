Let's play an arcade game that was successful at the time, Flappy Bird.

## Description
Flappy Bird is a popular mobile game developed by Dong Nguyen and published by dotGears. The game is a side-scrolling game in which the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without hitting them. The game is known for its simple yet challenging gameplay, as well as its retro-style graphics.

A version of the game made with TypeScript would be a re-implementation of the original game, but written in TypeScript instead of the original programming language. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features, making it a popular choice for large-scale projects. A version of Flappy Bird made in TypeScript would likely have improved scalability and maintainability compared to the original version, as well as improved developer productivity.
